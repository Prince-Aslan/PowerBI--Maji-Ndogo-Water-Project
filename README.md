# Power BI -Maji Ndogo Water Project

## Project Overview
### The project focused on addressing the water crises faced by the Maji Ndogo Community using Power BI 

## A deep look:
I imported tables (.csv files) separately, cleaned the data data, and set up a working relational data model in Power BI. 
I created the visuals with the new data model, customized text, colors, and fonts to make the visuals clear and simple.
I used DAX to create measures and columns to enrich our data to ensure accurate and useful data representation on the dashboard. 
Then I finalized the national survey report and then built a public dashboard with the aim of communicating my findings via these dashboards. 
I tracked the total budget against project completion for vaious states respectively, analysed crime related events, Queue patterns, etc in addressing Maji Ndogoâ€™s water crisis.
